This application is a simple proof of concept that visualizes the data in the given excel sheet. The user can search by batter name, and view their batting statistics. 

It uses jquery, php, and an sqlite database.

Further work can be done by a) normalizing the database b) organizing the display of videos at a new endpoint like /batter.php/batterid/videos, and c) allowing to search by game (based on date).

It can be run in the browser using a localhost server like XAMPP.
